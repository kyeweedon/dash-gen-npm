<pre><code>npm search [--long] [search terms ...]

npm se [search terms ...]
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Search the registry for packages matching the search terms.</p>
<p>If a term starts with <code>/</code>, then it&#39;s interpreted as a regular expression.
A trailing <code>/</code> will be ignored in this case.  (Note that many regular
expression characters must be escaped or quoted in most shells.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Default: false</li>
<li>Type: Boolean</li>
</ul>
<p>Display full package descriptions and other long text across multiple
lines. When disabled (default) search results are truncated to fit
neatly on a single line. Modules with extremely long names will
fall on multiple lines.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>npm.commands.search(searchTerms, [silent,] [staleness,] callback)
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Search the registry for packages matching the search terms. The available parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>searchTerms:
Array of search terms. These terms are case-insensitive.</li>
<li>silent:
If true, npm will not log anything to the console.</li>
<li>staleness:
This is the threshold for stale packages. &quot;Fresh&quot; packages are not refreshed
from the registry. This value is measured in seconds.</li>
<li><p>callback:
Returns an object where each key is the name of a package, and the value
is information about that package along with a &#39;words&#39; property, which is
a space-delimited string of all of the interesting words in that package.
The only properties included are those that are searched, which generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>maintainers</li>
<li>url</li>
<li>keywords</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A search on the registry excludes any result that does not match all of the
search terms. It also removes any items from the results that contain an
excluded term (the &quot;searchexclude&quot; config). The search is case insensitive
and doesn&#39;t try to read your mind (it doesn&#39;t do any verb tense matching or the
like).</p>
