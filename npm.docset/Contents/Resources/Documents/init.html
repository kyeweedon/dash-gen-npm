<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>npm init
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This will ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package.json for you.</p>
<p>It attempts to make reasonable guesses about what you want things to be set to,
and then writes a package.json file with the options you&#39;ve selected.</p>
<p>If you already have a package.json file, it&#39;ll read that first, and default to
the options in there.</p>
<p>It is strictly additive, so it does not delete options from your package.json
without a really good reason to do so.</p>

<p>Since this function expects to be run on the command-line, it doesn&#39;t work very
well as a programmatically. The best option is to roll your own, and since
JavaScript makes it stupid simple to output formatted JSON, that is the
preferred method. If you&#39;re sure you want to handle command-line prompting,
then go ahead and use this programmatically.</p>
